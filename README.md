# DESCRIPTION
This project is a command line application.  The user starts by choosing if which option they would like to do, such as "View all Departments," "View all Roles," or "Update Employee." When the user makes a choice, they are able to complete all tasks through the command line.  MYSQL was used to build the database and tables that hold department and employee information.

*Not all functions have bene completed to make this a fully functional project.  I ran out of time to complete the remainder of the functions.
